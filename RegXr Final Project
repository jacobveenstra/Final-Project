RegExr

First step was to put the 1953-08-13.txt edition into the RegExr

Next step is to create an expression to show what information we would like to see

In this case it is how many times Quebec and Ontario are mentioned in this edition of Equity

I had a lot of trouble creating an expression to do this

I know that there is a better way to create an expression in RegExr but I was unable to do it other than this way

(Quebe)\w+ is the expression that I put into the machine to get the results

I could not figure out a way to type in Quebec without it not showing up anything

I tried all the different tips in the tutorial and from the the exercise but just could not figure it out

using this code still got me the result I wanted as the only words that come up for that expression would be "Quebec"

The result was that there was 20 matches of the word Quebec in that edition

Next was to figure out how many times Ontario was mentioned 

the expression for this was (Ontari)\w+

Once again was unable to find out how to create the expression without leaving out the last letter

The results were 31 matches of the word Ontario in the document

I wanted to see if this was just the theme for this edition so I decided to test another edition on their results

Using the same code for Quebec and using an edition from a year earlier (1952-08-14) I was able to find that there was 16 hits in this edition for Quebec

Using the Ontario code I was able to only find 11 hits from this edition

this was very different then the first year I looked at

I will once again look at the year before (1951)

The 1951-08-16 edition has 31 results for Quebec and 11 for Ontario

Lastly I will look at the 1950-08-10 edition

It had 8 matches for Quebec and only 5 matches for Ontario

This is a total of 65 for Quebec and 58 for Ontario
